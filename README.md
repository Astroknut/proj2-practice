Project 2: Hoppy Hour

If you're one of the tens of people who just LOVE Brewdog Brewery's ridiculously large beer selection, this is the app for you. 

Have you ever found yourself daydreaming about a crisp, refreshing pint of Vagabond Pilsner? Then you have probably thought to yourself: "I really wish there was some way for me to make a list of all of my favorite Brewdog beers, so I can read all about them whenever I want!"

Well rub my lamp and call me Genie, because your wish is my command! Introducing Hoppy Hour! An App designed specifically for you, the only person who has nothing better to do than to go through a random list of beers no one else has heard of and save them to a list(Who doesn't love a good list?). Now introducing our newest feature: "Delete"! Not only can you save beers to your own personal list, but now you delete them from that very same list! Lucky you! Well what are you waiting for? No one else is ever going to use this app, so get in there and start making some lists!

//API
This app uses the Punk API v2 from Brewdog Brewery as a thris party API, and the source of every single beer you will come across in the app. If you are interested in seeing exactly how easy this API was to use and how little I actually managed to make work, check out https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 for more documentation. 

//Style
To keep up with the changing times, and to appease the minimalist lifestyle of the users who obviously have nothing better to do than use this app, you will find there is NO CSS. WHAT A BOLD MOVE, YOU SAY??? Design inspires trust, you say? Well so does alcohol, and theres a good chance if you're using this app that alcohol was involved.(Don't worry, you'll see some styles in the next version....or 3). 

//Authentication
"Well, at least your use of Passport to verify users and ensure their credentials stay secure is impressive." Jokes on you, i'm not even sure how that works. But hey, it gets you into the app and the password saved in our database is sure to make you second guess your drinking habits. Guess you'll just have to trust I wasn't drunk when I built the authentication methods(thats would be a mistake).
