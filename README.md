Project 2: Hoppy Hour

If you're one of the tens of people who just LOVE Brewdog Brewery's ridiculously large beer selection, this is the app for you. 

Have you ever found yourself daydreaming about a crisp, refreshing pint of Vagabond Pilsner? Then you have probably thought to yourself: "I really wish there was some way for me to make a list of all of my favorite Brewdog beers, so I can read all about them whenever I want!"

Well rub my lamp and call me Genie, because your wish is my command! Introducing Hoppy Hour! An App designed specifically for you, the only person who has nothing better to do than to go through a random list of beers no one else has heard of and save them to a list(Who doesn't love a good list?). Now introducing our newest feature: "Delete"! Not only can you save beers to your own personal list, but now you delete them from that very same list! Lucky you! Well what are you waiting for? No one else is ever going to use this app, so get in there and start making some lists!
